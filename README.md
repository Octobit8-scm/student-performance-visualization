# student-performance-visualization

## Objective
To  track  and  analyze  student  performance across subjects and exams. This allows educators to identify trends, pinpoint areas where students struggle, and make data-driven interventions to enhance learning outcomes.

## Implementation
1.	Data Sources
 - Student exam results (scores for various subjects).
 - Attendance records (to identify performance-impacting factors).
 - Stored in formats like CSV files or databases.
2.	Libraries Used
 - Matplotlib: To create clear and simple static visualizations like bar and line charts.
 - Seaborn: To generate advanced statistical visualizations like heatmaps and correlation plots.
 - Dash: For developing interactive dashboards that allow teachers and administrators to explore data dynamically.
3.	Types of Visualizations
 - Bar Charts: Visualize subject-wise scores for a single or group of students.
 - Heatmaps: Analyze performance patterns across subjects and discover correlations between them.
 - Line Charts: Track trends in student performance across multiple exams.
   
## Expected Outcome
By implementing this use case, educational institutions can:
 - Identify subjects where students struggle or excel.
 - Track improvement or decline in performance across multiple assessments.
 - Use correlations to explore factors influencing student performance (e.g., attendance and scores).
